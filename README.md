# Escapey
This is a simple 2d game where the user(a white ring) has to reach to the finish line without colliding with the balls in the way.
This game is made using canvas api in javascript.
I got inspiration from the mdn doc https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object_building_practice to build this game.
I would love for you to check the code and contribute to it.
Hope you enjoy the game!
